# ðŸ§¬ Conway's Game of Life â€“ Pygame Implementation

A visual and interactive simulation of Conway's Game of Life built with Python and Pygame.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- Each cell on the grid is either **alive** or **dead**
- The simulation evolves based on simple rules:
  - A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives
  - A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
  - All other cells die or remain dead
- Use the **Start/Stop** and **Random** buttons to control the simulation
- Click on the grid to set or remove live cells
